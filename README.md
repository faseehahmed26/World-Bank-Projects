## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of World Bank project data, focusing on predicting project outcomes using machine learning techniques. The analysis uses XGBoost classification to identify key factors that influence whether development projects will be successfully completed or dropped.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Predict World Bank project outcomes (Closed vs. Dropped) with high precision and recall
- Identify the most influential factors determining project success
- Develop a robust model that handles class imbalance and missing data
- Provide actionable insights for better project planning and risk assessment

## üìã Dataset

The dataset contains information about World Bank project lending across 27 features:

- **Basic Info**: Project ID, region, country, status, name, and URL
- **Financial Data**: Project cost, IBRD/IDA commitments, grant amounts
- **Timeline**: Board approval date, closing date
- **Classifications**: Environmental assessment codes, risk ratings
- **Sectors & Themes**: Primary sectors and thematic focuses

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory analysis revealed several key insights:

- The dataset is significantly imbalanced (90% closed, 10% dropped projects)
- High missing data rates in certain fields (30%+ in key variables)
- Regional and financial type variations in project outcomes
- Distinct patterns in environmental assessment categories

## üßÆ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling of missing values and data type conversions
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Addressing class imbalance

2. **Model Development**:
   - XGBoost classification with optimized hyperparameters
   - RandomizedSearchCV for parameter tuning
   - Evaluation metrics prioritizing F1 score due to class imbalance

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Precision (80.6%) and Recall (64.6%) assessment
   - Error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

## üìà Results

The optimized XGBoost model achieved:
- **F1 Score**: 71.7%
- **Precision**: 80.6%
- **Recall**: 64.6%
- **Accuracy**: 94.6%
- **RMSE**: 0.233
